# NODEJS-COOKIES

<img width="50%" src="./src/public/images/nodejs_cookies_template.png" />

## INTRODUCTION

In this project we will learn how to create cookies through our **Node.js** server using **Express.js** framework and the npm library called "cookie-parser", which allows us to manage cookies in a simple way through simple JavaScript functions.
Cookies are not related to a specific framework, so you can use any other **Node.js** backend framework.

## TECHNOLOGIES

- Express.js

3. Execute the command from the terminal located at ./NODEJS-COOKIES.

<br />

13. By clicking again on the second and third skrelv we will corroborate by console that no mite cookies were found. <br /> Keep in mind that the mite cookie has an expiration time of 10 seconds so, after executing the previous step after this time after having created the mite cookie, it will show the same messages.
